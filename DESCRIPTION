Description: MGlashfm jointly fine-maps signals in multiple population groups and several related quantitative traits, borrowing information 
	     between traits in a Bayesian framework. MGfm is also available for fine-mapping signals across multiple population groups for a single trait.
	     These methods do not restrict analysis to the intersecting variants across groups, allowing detection of causal variants that may be present in a
	     subset of groups due to low MAF or quality control.
	     MGflashfm and MGfm output multi-group credible sets for each trait.
